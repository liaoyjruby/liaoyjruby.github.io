    "text": "Hi friends!\nI’m currently a PhD student in the Wyatt Lab at the Vancouver Prostate Centre studying prostate cancer genomics, as part of the University of British Columbia (UBC) Genome Science and Technology (GSAT) program.\nPreviously, I graduated from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2022 with a BS in Computational & Systems Biology with a Concentration in Data Science. I was a Research Assistant at the Graeber Lab, where I contributed to a project characterizing recurrent ovarian cancers and assisted with the UCLA Metabolomics Center.\nCheck out my CV or LinkedIn for more of my background.\nIn my free time, I enjoy listening to music (indie/alt/pop/k-pop/electronic) and playing video games (simulation/sandbox/story-driven)."
