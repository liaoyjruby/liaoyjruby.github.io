    "text": "Hi friends!\nI’m currently a Master of Science student in the Genome Science and Technology (GSAT) program at University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver.\nPreviously, I graduated from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2022 with a BS in Computational & Systems Biology with a Concentration in Data Science. I was a Research Assistant at the Graeber Lab, where I contributed to a project characterizing recurrent ovarian cancers and assisted with the UCLA Metabolomics Center.\nCheck out my CV or LinkedIn for more of my background.\nIn my free time, I enjoy listening to music (pop/k-pop/indie/electronic) and playing video games (simulation/sandbox/story-driven)."
