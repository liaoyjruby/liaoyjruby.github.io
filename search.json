I was a Research Assistant at the Graeber Lab, where I contributed to a project characterizing recurrent ovarian cancers and assisted with the UCLA Metabolomics Center.\nCheck out my CV or LinkedIn for more of my background.\nIn my free time, I enjoy listening to music (pop/k-pop/indie/electronic) and playing video games (simulation/sandbox/story-driven)."
