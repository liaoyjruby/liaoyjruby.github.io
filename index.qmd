Hi friends! :^)

I'm currently a Computational Research Assistant at the [Graeber Lab](https://systems.crump.ucla.edu/), where I'm part of a project characterizing recurrent ovarian cancers. I also assist the [UCLA Metabolomics Center](https://systems.crump.ucla.edu/metabolomics_center/) with quality control and exploratory data analysis of mass spectrometry metabolomics data. 

Previously, I graduated from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2022 with a BS in [Computational & Systems Biology](https://casb.ucla.edu/) with a Concentration in Data Science. Check out [my CV](cv.qmd) for more of my background.

In my free time, I enjoy [listening to music](https://www.last.fm/user/rubsyl) (pop/k-pop/indie/electronic), playing video games (simulation/sandbox/story-driven), and figuring out ways to optimize my personal workflow efficiency.
