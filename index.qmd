Hi friends!

I'm currently a Master of Science student in the Genome Science and Technology (GSAT) program at University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver.

Previously, I graduated from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2022 with a BS in [Computational & Systems Biology](https://casb.ucla.edu/) with a Concentration in Data Science. I was a Research Assistant at the [Graeber Lab](https://systems.crump.ucla.edu/), where I contributed to a project characterizing recurrent ovarian cancers and assisted with the [UCLA Metabolomics Center](https://systems.crump.ucla.edu/metabolomics_center/).

Check out [my CV](YiJouLiao_CV_230428.pdf) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liaoyjruby/) for more of my background.

In my free time, I enjoy [listening to music](https://www.last.fm/user/rubsyl) (pop/k-pop/indie/electronic) and playing video games (simulation/sandbox/story-driven).
