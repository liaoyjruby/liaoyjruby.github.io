Hi friends!

I'm currently a University of British Columbia (UBC) [Genome Science and Technology (GSAT)](https://www.gsat.ubc.ca/) PhD student in the [Wyatt Lab](https://blogs.ubc.ca/wyattlab/) at the [Vancouver Prostate Centre](https://www.prostatecentre.com/) studying prostate cancer genomics.

Previously, I graduated from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2022 with a BS in [Computational & Systems Biology](https://casb.ucla.edu/) with a Concentration in Data Science. I was a Research Assistant at the [Graeber Lab](https://systems.crump.ucla.edu/), where I contributed to a project characterizing recurrent ovarian cancers and assisted with the [UCLA Metabolomics Center](https://systems.crump.ucla.edu/metabolomics_center/).

Check out [my CV](YJRubyLiao_CV_2405.pdf) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liaoyjruby/) for more of my background.

In my free time, I enjoy [listening to music](https://www.last.fm/user/rubsyl) (indie/alt/pop/k-pop/electronic) and playing video games (simulation/sandbox/story-driven).
